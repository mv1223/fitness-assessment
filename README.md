## 🧪 Testing the App

### Demo Credentials
- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** admin123

### Test Flow
1. Launch the app
2. Login with demo credentials
3. Select a fitness test from the dashboard
4. Follow the video recording instructions
5. Wait for AI analysis to complete
6. View your results and performance metrics

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
API_BASE_URL=https://api.sai-fitness-assessment.com
